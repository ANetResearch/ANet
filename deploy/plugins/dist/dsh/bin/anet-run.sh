#!/bin/sh
# Runs the anet executable that the plugin settings select, for the identity
# that they select: `sh anet-run.sh <arguments>` is `anet [--id <name>]
# <arguments>`. The MCP launcher and the skills use this script, so that every
# command reaches the same executable and the same node.
#
# Settings. The MCP server receives them in ANET_PLUGIN_BIN and
# ANET_PLUGIN_IDENTITY, with ANET_PLUGIN_SETTINGS=env. In any other context the
# script reads the same two variables from its own environment, and nothing
# else.
#
# Executable. A configured anetPath is used as it is and is never replaced by
# another copy. Without it, PATH and the install locations of the anet
# installer and Homebrew are searched, because a desktop application does not
# always inherit the PATH of a login shell. In a POSIX shell on Windows (Git
# Bash, MSYS2, Cygwin) a drive path is also absolute, and the install locations
# of the Windows installer are searched for anet.exe; anet-run.cmd is the
# runner for PowerShell and cmd.
#
# `sh anet-run.sh --resolve` prints the selected executable, version and
# identity, and the command line of this script, and always exits 0. Errors go
# to stderr with exit status 1.
